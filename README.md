## Learning Log

Learning Log is a demo application taken from the book _Python Crash Course_.
It is written in Python using the Django web framework. It is an  online journal system that lets you keep
track of information you’ve learned about particular topics.
<p>
It allows users to log the topics they’re interested in and to make journal entries as
they learn about each topic. Once logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, and read
and edit existing entries.</p>
